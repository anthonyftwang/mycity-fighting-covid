    <p>…And we have a blog! To make posts, all you have to do is add a new markdown file to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder. Markdown is a super-readable markup language that’s perfect for blogging. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Here’s</a> a popular cheatsheet. This sample blog is hosted with Jekyll, which has great integration with GitHub Pages. However, you can also blog with Wordpress, Medium, or whatever floats your boat!</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>To quickly customize this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update the title, description, email, and url in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></li>
  <li>You can change the logo text to your city in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/_includes/header.html</code></li>
  <li>Ditto for the footer links, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/_includes/footer.html</code></li>
  <li>You can customize the CSS theming in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/assets/css/style.css</code></li>
</ul>
